    <article>
      <p>Over recent years, the AI landscape has shifted from static prompt-response systems to autonomous, goal-driven agents. This evolution—what many call <strong>Agentic AI</strong>—makes it possible for AI systems to plan, reason, and act independently toward defined outcomes.</p>

      <p>At the same time, product teams still rely on a time-tested principle: the <strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong>. The combination of both ideas—an <em>Agentic MVP</em>—lets teams build intelligent, useful AI products quickly without costly experimentation cycles. In this article we’ll unpack what Agentic AI is, why the MVP mindset still matters, and how to ship your first agentic MVP.</p>

      <h2>What is Agentic AI?</h2>
      <p>Traditional AI models are reactive: you ask, they answer. Agentic AI introduces autonomy, multi-step reasoning, and tool use. An <em>agent</em> is a digital collaborator that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>understands intent rather than just a literal prompt,</li>
        <li>decomposes goals into actionable subtasks,</li>
        <li>calls APIs, queries data stores, runs code, or performs external actions, and</li>
        <li>adjusts behavior based on results or feedback.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Frameworks like <strong>LangChain</strong>, <strong>LangGraph</strong>, and orchestration patterns such as <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> have made it easy to wire models with tools and workflows. Agentic systems now power customer support assistants, research agents, and automated data pipelines—with minimal human supervision for defined scopes.</p>

      <h2>The MVP Mindset Meets Agentic Design</h2>
      <p>MVP thinking forces focus: build the smallest version of your idea that still delivers core value. When applied to agentic systems, the focus shifts from features to <em>capabilities</em>. Instead of asking "what features should I include?", product teams should ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What autonomy does the agent need?</li>
        <li>Which tools or APIs must it access?</li>
        <li>How will we evaluate its reasoning and decisions early?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Example: a <strong>Bank Helpdesk Agent MVP</strong> can start with three capabilities: retrieval-augmented answers from policy PDFs (RAG), API access to check account balances, and the ability to raise or update tickets. These capabilities demonstrate autonomous reasoning and tool use without automating every possible workflow.</p>

      <h2>Why this combination matters</h2>
      <p>Blending Agentic AI with MVP methodology provides several advantages:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Faster iteration</strong> — trace the agent’s thinking (thought logs) and quickly iterate prompts, chains, or tool logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower risk</strong> — start with a single specialist agent, validate value, then expand into multi-agent systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Built-in scalability</strong> — stabilize a small agent and generalize its patterns across tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-AI collaboration</strong> — include humans-in-the-loop to catch edge cases and train the system safely.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Agentic MVP: A Practical Roadmap</h2>
      <p>Here’s a step-by-step blueprint you can follow to ship an Agentic MVP:</p>
      <pre>
1. Define a narrow, valuable goal.
   Example: generate meeting summaries + action items reliably.

2. Pick an orchestration framework.
   Examples: LangChain, LangGraph, or a lightweight custom controller.

3. Integrate 2–3 minimal tools.
   E.g., calendar API, transcript search, internal docs search.

4. Add reasoning evaluation.
   Use model traces and automated judges to test decision quality.

5. Measure human impact.
   Track time saved, accuracy of actions, and user trust, not just latency.

6. Iterate and expand.
   Add specialist agents (dataAgent, researchAgent) behind a supervisor when ready.
      </pre>

      <h2>Design principles & tips</h2>
      <p>When building an Agentic MVP, follow these practical rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep goals narrow:</strong> the smaller the scope, the faster the learning cycle.</li>
        <li><strong>Log everything:</strong> store prompts, tool calls, responses, and human overrides for debugging and improvement.</li>
        <li><strong>Use human-in-loop checkpoints:</strong> before full automation, gate risky actions behind approvals.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure real user value:</strong> prioritize metrics that reflect human outcomes (time saved, errors reduced, NPS).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>Agentic AI is a major step forward: from smart Q&amp;A to independent collaborators that plan and act. But raw power without product discipline risks wasted time and poor adoption. The MVP philosophy brings that discipline—helping teams deliver agentic systems that are useful, safe, and scalable.</p>

      <p>Remember: an <em>Agentic MVP</em> isn’t about building the most advanced agent on day one. It’s about building the most <strong>useful</strong> one.</p>
